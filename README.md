Developers/Team:

&
Abdulrahman Baflah

Language: Swift 6

Build tips:
- Please refrence Project 7 Pod Install.pdf to setup and install the necessary dependencies as described within the document 
- please check the connection of the GoogleServce-Info.plist file (as GitHub often alterns the symlink)
- contact us regarding any other issues (there shouldn't really be any as long as you are running the latest version of XCode, and a supported version of iOS)
